I wanted to check  : 

Hey i wanted to check my application 5 Day before internal and email notification generating capability,
that if any service handler who's 
purchase date for example  :  on monthly basis and he bought a service etc on 25 Oct 2025 right and so his next renewal date will be 25 Nov 2025
so the business unit service handler on which name the service boughted will get before 5 days a renwal internal internal notification and email notification that
are you using this service or not ,
like on 20 Nov 2025 right ,

so the catch question is currently the service handlers who's accounts were not created yet and the service already pruchased on name of them, 
so when their will be maded you system show the entries who are pruchased on name of them,

but there is a scianrio our current system show them a already entered entries which are pruchased on name of them 
and in future when thier accounts maded our system show all entries allot to them,

so one tricky scinario comes i just checked,  that i entered a entry as business unit spoc :
and the entry date is 25 Nov 2025 and recurring i puted Monthly and my business unit admin / super admin did'nt 
maded the account of that service handler on who's name i purchsed the service right ,

so if we see in perpective of system entry is maded of 25 Nov 2025 and for example today is 20 Dec 2025 ,
so technically our system needs to generate a service renewal internal notification and email notification to the service handler right 
but the catch is our system dont know the service handler name yet and his account is not created yet, so 
whom the system send renewal notification, if this type of scinario comes , like and if a super admin makes that service handler account
on 21 Dec 2025 and the service handler loggin first time he saw all service entries purchased on name of him, 
But the renwal notification he did'not got cause his account is created day after the reminder notification,

so what solution would there , case i thought is : case 1 : if his account maded on 21 or 24 or 26 he will surely get the internal notification and 
email notification of service renewal request on 20 Jan 2026 or according to recurring type Monthly or yearly.

case 2 :  if his account created on before 2 days of 2 days auto cancel request email and notification t0 service handler and MIS email
he still got to see the service renewal notification 

so what you think what is best , and currently our system is working with which case
