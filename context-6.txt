1. I have a question for you, how my cronjobs working in synchronization with the application and its functions


2. Hey i have a scinario based question for you, as per my application 

for example  :  a entry has been maded in bulk upload or manual entry added, 
and in that entry Status is active , busines unit spoc already presnt , service handler is already present in the
system and his recurring plan is quaterly and the purchase date was maded is 11 jan 2026 , what will be systemetic process for this entry


3. hey for example if service user manually disable the service before the renewal reminder date of before 5 days of next renewal date so will he 
get the renewal reminder email and in app notification ?


4. yes the flow is if user manually click disable on end of the service he logs right the email and password and the service cancel request went to mis email 
and in app notificatikon of that service cancellation as requested by the service handler and mis maually edit and disable that service status deactive , is it in 
my system? so for the same will the service handler get the renewal notification ever ? of that service who has been status deactive by the mis as requested by the service handler ?



5. will our system handles 10 lakh plus entiries in one year if i have db space in mongodb , and work same for each entry in the system ?

ans 5 : Short answer: storage isn’t the limiter; performance is. With 10 lakh+ entries/year, the current code can store them, but some queries and cron jobs will slow down unless you add the right indexes and pagination.

Key reasons (from the current code):

Existing indexes are limited to businessUnit/date, serviceHandler, entryStatus, cardNumber. See ExpenseEntry.js.
Cron jobs filter by status, nextRenewalDate, renewalNotificationSent, autoCancellationNotificationSent, and updatedAt. Those fields aren’t indexed, so MongoDB will scan a lot as the table grows. See cronJobs.js.
/api/logs loads all expense entries + all renewal logs into memory and sorts them. That will get heavy at scale. See logController.js.
So yes, it can “work,” but the experience will degrade without tuning. If you want this to scale reliably, the usual fixes are:

Add compound indexes for the cron filters (e.g., status + entryStatus + nextRenewalDate + renewalNotificationSent, and entryStatus + updatedAt).
Add pagination/limits for logs and listing endpoints.
Consider archiving old entries or moving cron to a dedicated worker.
If you want, I can recommend exact indexes and where to add pagination, based on your real query patterns.
